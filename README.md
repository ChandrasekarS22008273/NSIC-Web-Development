# NSIC-Web-Development
A challenge in web coding within the NSIC institute among students.

## Profile:
I am Chandrasekar S from Saveetha Engineering College . I've joined as an intern in the NSIC Web Development Course. The duration of this course is 4 weeks . The reason why I chose web development course is that I, personally like to develop a website . I've already finished a course on web development in Internshala (which was a 3 months course). In that course, I was only be able to cover the frontend development ,unfortunately not the backend . But I'm looking forward to learn the frontend again along with the backend in this NSIC Internship . Thank youuu xD
